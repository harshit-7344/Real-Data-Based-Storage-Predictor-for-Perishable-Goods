# Real Data-Based Storage Predictor for Perishable Goods  

## 📌 Overview  
Managing perishable goods like **tomatoes, mangoes, and onions** is challenging due to fluctuating market prices and storage limitations. This project **analyzes real market, weather, and supply chain data** to help farmers and traders decide **whether to sell immediately or store for better profits**.  

## 🚀 Features  
- **📈 Market Price Forecasting** – Uses **Prophet, LSTM** to predict future prices.  
- **🤖 Smart Storage Decisions** – Reinforcement learning (**Q-learning**) optimizes selling time.  
- **🌦️ Weather & Supply Chain Analysis** – Considers **temperature, humidity, and transport costs**.  
- **🔍 Real-Time Market Insights** – Web scraping for **agricultural news and trends**.  
- **📊 Data Visualization** – Exports insights to **Tableau/Power BI** for better decision-making.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **Machine Learning** (Prophet, LSTM, Q-learning)  
- **SQL** for data storage  
- **BeautifulSoup** for web scraping  
- **Tableau/Power BI** for visualization  

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset includes:  
- Market prices of perishable crops  
- Weather conditions (temperature, humidity, rainfall)  
- Supply chain & transportation costs  
- Demand index and storage capacity
